   * Fix a buffer overflow in mbedtls_pk_write_pubkey(),
     mbedtls_pk_write_pubkey_der(), mbedtls_pk_write_pubkey_pem(),
     mbedtls_pk_write_key_der() and mbedtls_pk_write_key_pem().
     With MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO turned on, these functions would
     write to a location before the start of the output buffer if it was less
     than the size of the key being written and also less than
     PK_MAX_EC_PUBLIC_KEY_SIZE (for EC public keys) and
     PSA_EXPORT_KEY_PAIR_MAX_SIZE (for RSA private keys).
     This buffer overflow only occurs for keys with the type MBEDTLS_PK_OPAQUE.
